## **Introduction**
The term tokenomics encompasses a wide range of concepts that defines the science and behavior of blockchain economies. In simple terms, tokenomics are the financial foundation of blockchains. Each protocol has its unique economic model, and for the protocol's healthy and enduring development, the economic model should include design, distribution, and management of tokens, as well as the incentives and mechanisms that drive their value and utilization.

The JustLend tokenomics  is designed to promote a healthy, long term self-sustaining economy with participant incentives aligned to the security and decentralization of the network. The main participants in this economy are suppliers, borrowers and clients who stakes TRX or USDT. The protocol revenue from users will be used to optimize income distribution and cater to the protocol's present and future needs.

## **The JustLend Economy**
JustLend DAO is a decentralized governance protocol, where users can participate in governance using the platform token JUST (Symbol: JST) to make decisions about the development of JustLend DAO.  The platform has integrated multiple independent DeFi protocols and plans to incorporate more to form the JustLend economy. There are four integrated protocols characterize the JustLend economy:

* **SBM (Supply and Borrow Market):**  A supply and borrow market protocol launched in December 2020.
* **sTRX (Staked TRX):**  A high-efficiency and yield TRON network staking pool launched in April 2023.
* **JustStable Coin (USDJ):** A stablecoin minting protocol launched in April 2020, which was the first application protocol of JST.
* **Energy Rental:** A platform for flexible and low-cost energy rental on the TRON network launched in April 2023, significantly reducing transaction costs.

## **SBM - Supply and Borrow Market**
SBM is a TRON-powered money market protocol designed to create fund pools with interest rates determined by an algorithm based on the supply and demand of TRON assets. The protocol involves two key roles: suppliers and borrowers, who directly engage with the protocol to earn or pay a floating interest rate. SBM serves as the core protocol of JustLend DAO.

Within SBM, each money market corresponds to a unique TRON asset, such as TRX, TRC20 stablecoins (e.g., USDT), or other TRC20-based tokens. The protocol features an open and transparent ledger that records all transactions and historical interest rates.
