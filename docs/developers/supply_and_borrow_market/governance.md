# Governance

JustLend DAO protocol is governed and upgraded by JST holders. There are three components included in the governance system: [JST](https://tronscan.org/#/token20/TCFLL5dx5ZJdKnWuesXxi1VPwjLVmWZZy9)([WJST](https://tronscan.org/#/contract/TXk9LnTnLN7oH96H3sKxJayMxLxR9M4ZD6/code)) token,
governance module([GovernorBravo](https://tronscan.org/#/contract/TEqiF5JbhDPD77yjEfnEMncGRZNDt2uogD/code)) and [Timelock](https://tronscan.org/#/contract/TRWNvb15NmfNKNLhQpxefFz7cNjrYjEw7x). The governance of the JustLend DAO protocol is through proposals, whose process can be summarized as proposal posting-voting-taking effect.

`GovernorBravoDelegate.sol:` allows users to:

* Propose
* Queue
* Execute
* Cancel
* Deposit
* Vote

The source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/justlend/justlend-protocol/blob/main/contracts/Governance/Bravo/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol).
