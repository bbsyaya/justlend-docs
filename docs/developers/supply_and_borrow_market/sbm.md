# SBM

The JustLend DAO Supply and Borrow Market (SBM) is a decentralized  liquidity pool where users can participate as suppliers, borrowers or liquidators. Suppliers provide liquidity to a market and can earn interest on the assets provided, where borrowers are able to borrow in a collateralize assets way.

The SBM contract is the main user-facing contract. Most user interactions with the JustLend DAO Protocol occur via the Ctoken contract. It exposes the liquidity management methods that can be invoked using either Solidity or Web3 libraries.

`Ctoken.sol:` allows users to:

* Supply
* Borrow
* Withdraw
* Reapy
* Liquidation

The source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/justlend/justlend-protocol/blob/main/contracts/CToken.sol).
