# Comptroller

The Comptroller is the risk management module of the JustLend DAO protocol. It determines how much collateral should users keep to avoid liquidation.
The Comptroller is implemented as an upgradable contract. The entrance is [Unitroller](https://tronscan.org/#/contract/TGjYzgCyPobsNS9n6WcbdLVR9dH7mWqFx7/code); the implementation is [Comptroller](https://tronscan.org/#/contract/TJZi9eWzCLGBi9tuwvPxnaZTGa2iUpRc8v/code).

`Comptroller.sol:` allows users to:

* Markets
* Get Assets In
* Get Account Liquidation
* Liquidation Incentive

The source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/justlend/justlend-protocol/blob/main/contracts/Comptroller.sol).
