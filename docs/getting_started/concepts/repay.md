Repaying borrowed tokens is a critical aspect of managing borrow positions on the JustLend DAO Protocol. With flexible repayment options and user-friendly tools, JustLend DAO makes it easy for borrowers to maintain healthy collateralisation ratios and prevent liquidation risks.

Borrowers can repay their loans using the same tokens they borrowed or through jTokens (collateral tokens) of the same underlying asset. Here are some benefits of repayment:

* By reducing the outstanding borrow amount, repayment strengthens the collateralisation ratio, ensuring the position remains adequately collateralised;
* A higher collateralisation ratio minimizes the risk of liquidation by maintaining a safe margin between the collateral value and the borrowed amount;
* Repayment allows borrowers to safely withdraw a portion of their collateral, offering greater flexibility in managing their assets.

#### Repay Assets:
1. Connect your Web3 wallet on TronLink or other supported wallet app to the JustLend DAO ([https://justlend.org](https://justlend.org)).
2. Navigate to the "SBM" and choose the borrowed asset you want to withdraw, click 「Repay」.
3. Specify the amount you want to repay and confirm the transaction.
