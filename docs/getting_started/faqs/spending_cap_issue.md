#### **Why Is the Available Spending Cap Insufficient?**

* If you previously set a custom Spending Cap during the approve transaction, and that Spending Cap has been partially used, you may encounter an **"Insufficient Spending Cap"** hint when the remaining Spending Cap is less than the amount of your current transaction.
    * In this case, you will need to authorize again, and the new spending cap amount must be **greater than or equal to** the amount you intend to transact.
    * **Please note:** a new authorization will overwrite the previous spending cap rather than add to the remaining balance. Therefore, always ensure that the new spending cap is at least equal to your intended transaction amount to avoid failure.

* If you selected the default **"Unlimited Spending Cap"** when authorizing for the first time, you will not encounter this issue.
