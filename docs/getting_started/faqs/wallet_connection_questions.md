#### *Why does not my connected address on JustLend DAO change to the target address after I switch the address in my wallet?*
In this case, there may be two status of your wallet connection on JustLend DAO:
* If your wallet is disconnected, you can click the “Connect Wallet” button to connect your current address to JustLend DAO. This happens because the access to the current address has not been granted to JustLend DAO.
* If your wallet address remains unchanged, refresh the page. Then, JustLend DAO will automatically connect to the new address.

#### *When I have several wallet extensions, why is Wallet B invoked when I choose to connect to Wallet A?*
This is because some wallet extensions may have flaws in their adaptability. It’s recommended that you mainly use one wallet extension that suits your needs best. If multiple wallet extensions are needed, you can toggle off those wallet extensions that are not used at the moment in extension management to prevent this problem.

**Note:** After you toggle off other wallet extensions, refresh the JustLend DAO page and connect to it again.

#### *What can I do if JustLend DAO no longer responds after I switch from Wallet A to Wallet B and try to make a transaction?*
You can refresh the page and try to initiate the transaction again.

If the platform still fails to respond, toggle off Wallet A, refresh the page, and then try to make the transaction again.
